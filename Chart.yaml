# :language: yaml
# :start-at: "name: jenkins\n"
# :end-before: "###\n"
# ```
name: jenkins

###
# ```{rubric} Type
# ```
# ---
# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
#
# ```{literalinclude} /Chart.yaml
# :language: yaml
# :start-at: "type: application\n"
# :end-before: "###\n"
# ```
type: application

###
# ```{rubric} Version
# ```
# ---
# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
#
# ```{literalinclude} /Chart.yaml
# :language: yaml
# :start-at: "version: 0.0.2\n"
# ```
version: 0.0.1
